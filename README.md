# Learn OpenGL Renderer

![Renderer](/renderer.jpg)

This repository contains the OpenGL-based 3D renderer I built while following the Learn OpenGL tutorial, while adding some additional functionality.

The following items have been implemented:

* Multiple light types (point, directional, spot)
* Specular/Diffuse mapping
* Model loading
* Cube maps
* Face culling
* Basic scene editor (via imgui)
